      <p>
        It is SMB's policy to operate its business as a corporate citizen
        committed to sound environmental management and with concern for the
        well-being of our common environment. Our goal is to ensure that company
        facilities and operations are in compliance with governmental, federal,
        state and local environmental standards. We believe that an appropriate
        balance can and should be achieved between environmental goals and
        economic health. We intend to be a leader in responsible environmental
        management. This requires each SMB employee to participate in and accept
        responsibility for achieving the following goals:
      </p>
      <ul class="service__list">
        <li>Operations are conducted in an environmentally sound manner.</li>
        <li>Safe handling of production materials and by products.</li>
        <li>
          Conservation and recycling of raw materials and reduction in the
          amount of waste generated.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
        The company's commitment to these goals includes the following specific
        elements:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All SMB facilities and operations will operate in an environmentally
          responsible manner and in compliance with environmental laws and
          regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          SMB will maintain compliance programs to inform and train employees in
          the performance of their duty to full fill the company's environmental
          policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Through audits and other means, the company will monitor operations to
          help assure that practices in our workplaces conform to our policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          SMB management will make environmental responsiveness and resource
          conservation an integral part of business management, and will support
          finding sound solutions to such environmental problems as may arise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to the nature of SMB's business, sensible and responsible
          environmental management is principally a matter for our local
          operations. Each SMB facility is expected to manage its activities in
          a manner that will achieve the goals of this Environmental Policy.
          Each SMB employee is expected to work toward these goals and is
          encouraged to advise his or her supervisor promptly of any situation
          that may be in conflict with this Policy.
